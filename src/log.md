    - Call with Sam Senchal & Blaise Aguera, for feedback on Sam's research (see [God Conjecture](https://github.com/SASenchal/God-Conjecture)). Sam's next big milestone is a pitch to see if his theory can predict / guide empirical research. It is a possible framework/scaffolding for "rigorous ethics" (relevant for AI alignment, but also society alignment). Should be a lot of overlap with Sun's work.

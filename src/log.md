    - ORI member in Nigeria (owlcyon) got a computer! Donated by Shane (Canada)
    - Aleks Jakulin ([@aleksj](https://x.com/aleksj)) read Defender's substack & offered his company as legal infrastructure if we can raise the funds
    - ORI member Walter hired at Torus Network!
    - Met with Andrea P & Tom, and their local Ithaca network to compare notes on local/global alignment

    - Call with Sam Senchal & Blaise Aguera, for feedback on Sam's research (see [God Conjecture](https://github.com/SASenchal/God-Conjecture)). Sam's next big milestone is a pitch to see if his theory can predict / guide empirical research. It is a possible framework/scaffolding for "rigorous ethics" (relevant for AI alignment, but also society alignment). Should be a lot of overlap with Sun's work.

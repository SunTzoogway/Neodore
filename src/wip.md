# WIP

Things we are actively working on

- Company structure & MVP ("creating the funnels"?) (Lukas)
- ORI website & brand (Lukas)
- Defender writing (on a history of the past 2 years)
    - description of each project in the portfolio 
      - The framing is, what connects all of these? And I think the answer is: it's me progressively moving towards the highest leverage point & seeing how far I can go
    - case study of Community Archive
- Sun writing (on morality & alignment)
    - [substack](https://suntzoogway.substack.com/about)
    - first building block (objective / subjective?)
    - defining the landscape (who's doing what)
